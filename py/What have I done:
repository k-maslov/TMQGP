What have I done:

Relativistic corrections
Gluon suppression in interaction
Angular momentum in potential
Quasiparticle and self-energy pressure
Phi-functional pressure
Vacuum properties of mesons (?)
Super strongly coupled solution
Fit to the lattice at mu=0
Generalization to finite mu
First results at mu != 0
